<h1>Welcome to Computer Perception @ ECCV2022</h1>
  <b>Abstract</b>
  <p>Much of the research in Computer Vision has focused on solving individual tasks like image or video classification, object detection, object tracking, to name only a few. These settings are suitable for narrow applications, but for complex applications like embodied intelligent assistants or self-driving cars, we will need full perception models that deal with multiple modalities and have integrated scene understanding and reasoning capabilities comparable to humans.</p>
  <p>In this workshop, we propose to zoom out from Computer Vision and discuss more generally about Computer Perception, with leading thinkers from Computer Vision / Machine Learning and Cognitive Sciences / Neuroscience.</p>
  <p>Confirmed speakers: Jitendra Malik, Olga Russakovsky, Michael Auli, Daniel Yamins, Matthew Botvinick.</p> 
  <p>We will cover both modelling challenges and evaluation best practices. Additionally, we will organise a competition.</p>
